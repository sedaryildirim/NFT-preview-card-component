## My process

Had a lot of trouble with this challenge, mainly due to the fact that it was my first time
overlaying an image onto another one - everything worked locally with responsively / live server
however completely broke upon hitting github pages - took a break after 6 hours troubleshooting,
had some sleep and came back restarted from scratch and focused on getting the img effect to work before anything else and managed to finish in 120mins roughly.

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM naming structure
- SCSS

### What I learned

How to overlay images on others, BEM naming structure (think i got it now)

### Continued development

### Useful resources

- [Grid Lay It Out](https://grid.layoutit.com/) - Grid layouts & positioning
